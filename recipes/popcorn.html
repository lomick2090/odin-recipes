        <h2>Easy to Make Stovetop Popcorn</h2>
            <p>This recipe gives us an old classic made
            easy on the stovetop with simple ingredients
            and simple steps
            </p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <li>1/4 cup Popcorn Kernels (approximately 7 cups of popped popcorn)</li>
            <li>2 tblspns of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Morton Popcorn Salt</li>
            <li>1/4 lb melted butter</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour 2 Tablespoons (or so, depending on how big of a pan you use) of oil in the bottom of a medium/large pan. The oil should generously cover the bottom of the pan. Heat the pan over Medium/High heat.</li>
                <li>Put 3 test popcorn kernels in the pan and put on the cover on the pan.</li>
                <li>After you hear the test kernels pop, take off the lid.</li>
                <li>Add 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels to the pan and put the lid back on</li>
                <li>Allow the popcorn to pop.  Gently slide the pan around on the burner during the first few minutes of the process to avoid burning the kernels.   This is not so important once the popcorn really starts popping as everything is moving around pretty good when that happens.  Take the pan off the heat when the sound of kernels popping slows down.  The whole popping process should only take 3-4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Easy Peasy – that all you need to do to make perfect popcorn. And popcorn cooked this way tastes so much better than popcorn from the microwave. Once you have the popcorn made, salt it liberally.  We use Morton Popcorn Salt, it is super fine and really sticks to the popcorn.  Finally, add melted butter if you’d like. And WE do like! Now you know how to make perfect popcorn.  It is so easy and the finished product is 1000 times better than Microwave Popcorn.  You’ll love it … we promise!</li>
